# Python-Programming
Hey there! Thanks for checking out my Repo.

I'm Avinash, and I created this repository for python programming DSE. I am working on a Python course at SSCBS. I am using this repository to share some of the study materials and programs required for the course.

I want to help students find the study material and programs required for the course. This makes it easy for them to find what they need, when they need it, without having to search through a bunch of different repositories or websites.

How to contribute is also pretty simple: submit me a pull request of study material relevant to the repository
